# Puzzle_a_day
A set of Adobe Illus. plans to make a "Puzzle a Day"

You can use a laser cutter to engrave and cut out the BASE.  You can use any material that your laser 
can cut.  I used a 3mm thick sheet of plywood.
The RETAINER only needs to cut two paths.
The RETAINER is then glued onto the BASE.

The pieces can be cut out of clear or colored acrylic.

Rubbing alcohol can be used to remove the smoke marks off of the acrylic.
You can sand the plywood to remove the smoke marks from the wood.
